This repository is a place to throw [wxGlade](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxglade/) `.wxg` (XML project files) and working Perl script drivers to generate the GUI that are directly from wxGlade.
These are to be used as examples and starting points for wxPerl projects using wxGlade.
To set up the wxPerl environment on Windows, please see this page:

**See details on setting up modern, working wxPerl environment on Windows, complete with wxGlade (as of 2026!)** - [here](https://wiki.perl-guilds.net/index.php?title=Developing_and_Distributing_wxPerl_Applications_on_Windows).
